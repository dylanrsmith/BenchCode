User Interface
================



Generating UI
--------------

Generating the UI is handled by the *generate_ui* module.

The UI is sorted into several tabs. Each tab groups multiple SPN's together, usually by similar type. (DIG I/P, PWM O/P, VOLTAGE...)

Each Tab contains a number of labels, buttons, dropdown menus, and text boxes.

This module contains functions that handle the creation of widgets, and their placement within the UI.
